## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyterlab or notebook (to view and execute the notebook)

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains medical data for heart disease analysis. Ensure the dataset is properly preprocessed before running the analysis.

### Features of the Dataset:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Rest ECG
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- Oldpeak
- Slope
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Project.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to uncover insights about the data.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Modeling**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart disease.

## Results
The project demonstrates effective use of visualization and modeling techniques to predict heart disease. Detailed results and insights can be found within the notebook.
